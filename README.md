# ESP32-Wroom-Factory-Flash
ESP32 WROOM32 factory flash files

Repository for the factory flash files to restore an ESP32 Wroom module. 

Put here due to requests for the files.

Works for me on NodeMcu-32. So should work fine for the 30-pin ESP32 dev modules, Devkit1 etc.

Tube linked below gives details of how to re-flash the ESP32 using the on-line flash tool, (or you can download the desktop flash tool, found in this repository).
# However the links in the tube video are for the WRONG factory files, please use the ones here.

There are two files, I cannot remember which one I used, so try them both, one will work!

# PLEASE send me your feedback as to which file worked, any errors or issues, so I can update this readme.
