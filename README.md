# ESP32-Wroom-Factory-Flash
ESP32 WROOM32 factory flash files

Repository for the factory flash files to restore an ESP32 Wroom module. 

Put here due to requests for the files.

Works for me on NodeMcu-32. So should work fine for the 30-pin ESP32 dev modules, Devkit1 etc.

Tube linked below gives details of how to re-flash the ESP32 using the on-line flash tool, 

Or you can use the PC based flash download tool and my PDF guide how to use the PC based program & flash the firmware, both found in this repository.

# NOTE: - the links in the tube video are for the WRONG factory firmware, please use the Factory Flash files found in this repository.

There are two files, I cannot remember which one I used, so try them both, one will work!

# PLEASE send me your feedback as to which file worked, any errors or issues, so I can update this readme.
